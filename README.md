## Multi-scale and Multi-granularity Feature Learning for Cross-domain Fashion Retrieval (MMFL-Net)

This repository provides the generated dataset from our paper "Multi-scale and Multi-granularity Feature Learning for Cross-domain Fashion Retrieval." 

#### Datasets

##### **DeepFashion C2S**

DeepFashion is a large-scale clothing image dataset consisting of four benchmarks for various tasks in the apparel domain, including a subset of cross-domain apparel image retrieval that we use for our experiments.

##### **Street2Shop**

Street2Shop is the first large-scale fashion dataset with eleven different categories of fashion images: bags, belts, dresses, eyewear, footwear, hats, leggings, outerwear, pants, skirts, and tops.  The online shop images do not provide bbox annotations, so the un-cropped shop images are used as gallery images.

#### **Download Data**

To train a cross-domain fashion retrieval model, index files (training and retrieval validation files) and image data are required. All data included in this study can be found on Google Cloud Drive and can be downloaded through this [data download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CHOCetmhSfgaEt8LIxPAkqTsn-t61Zu?usp=sharing): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CHOCetmhSfgaEt8LIxPAkqTsn-t61Zu?usp=sharing.
